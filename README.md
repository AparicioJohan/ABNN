ABNN contains mxnet/python code for the GPU implementation of the Approximate Bayesian Neural Network presented in Waldmann (2018; Genetics Selection Evolution).

The code reads data from the QTLMAS2010ny012.csv file that can be found in the AUTALASSO repository. The y-varaible (phenotype) is in the first column and the x-variables (SNPs; coded 0,1,2) are in the following columns.
